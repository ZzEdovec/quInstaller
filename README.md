# ⬇️ quInstaller
Simple installer for you program. No compilation needed. (README in-progress)

### 🌍 Documentation language
English | [Русский](https://github.com/ZzEdovec/quInstaller/blob/main/README.ru.md)

### ❓ What is it?
quInstaller - a universal and simple installer for any program in any programming language. It does not require compilation every time you want to create a new installer. It also supports applications that use Java Runtime Environment (JRE) versions 8 and later due to the fact that it runs on the JVM itself!

## 🚀 Creating a installer
**Let's create our first quInstaller.**

1. Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/ZzEdovec/quInstaller/releases)
2. Unpack it somewhere

### ⚙️ Configuring installer
1. Open `installercfg.json` file in any text editor.
		You can configure the installer parameters in this file.
	#### Cross-platform parameters
	`AppName` - Name of your application **(REQUIRED)**

	`AppExec` - Main executable file of your program (on Linux, you can add arguments, see example [here](https://github.com/ZzEdovec/quInstaller?tab=readme-ov-file#Environment%20variables:~:text=configuration.%20For%20example%2C-,installercfg.json,-%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22AppName%22%3A%22Rudi%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22AppExec) **(REQUIRED)**
	#### Windows-only parameters
	`AppUsesRoot` - Specifies whether to force the request for administrator rights (UAC) 
	`Publisher` - Author or publisher of the application **(REQUIRED)**
	#### Linux-only parameters
	`GenericName` - Generic name of the application, for example `Web Browser`
	
2. Place the logo of your program in the same folder where the `main.exe` (or `installer.jar` on Linux) file is located and name it `appIcon.png`.
3. Pack all the files of your program that need to be installed into an archive named `package.zip` and place it in the same folder.

### 🗑️ Configuring uninstaller
**If your program creates additional folders** outside of its directory during operation, you can specify them inside the `AppCustomDirs` array in the `uninstallercfg.json` file. In this case, when deleting the program, the user will be prompted to delete these folders.

**If your program does not create such folders**, simply delete the `uninstallercfg.json` file.

### 🌐 Environment variables
**On Windows**, you can use [environment variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/usmt/usmt-recognized-environment-variables) when specifying folders in the uninstaller configuration.
For example,

> uninstallercfg.json

    {
        "AppCustomDirs":[
            "%TEMP%\\Rudi",
            "%APPDATA%\\Rudi"
        ]
    }

**On Linux**, you can only use `%TEMP%` or `%USERHOME%` variables in the **uninstaller** configuration, but unlike the Windows version, you can use the `%JAVA_BIN%` and `%APP_PATH%` variables in the `AppExec` param of **installer** configuration.
For example,

> installercfg.json

    {
        "AppName":"Rudi",
        "AppExec":"env GDK_BACKEND=x11 \"%JAVA_BIN%\" -jar \"%APP_PATH%/Rudi.jar\""
    }

### 🧪 Testing installer
After we have everything set up, run `main.exe` on Windows or `installer.jar` on Linux. 

If you don't have JRE 8 with JavaFX installed on **Linux**, use the JRE supplied with quInstaller to run it:
1. Open terminal and change dir (`cd`) to quInstaller main path
2. Execute the `jre/bin/java -jar quInstaller.jar` command

*If Java crashed with a critical error after executing the command and you are using Wayland, use the* `GDK_BACKEND=x11 jre/bin/java -jar quInstaller.jar` *command*

**Now, if the installer has started without errors, you can proceed to the next step.** However, if the installer has issued a file corruption alert, check for `package.zip`, `appIcon.png` and `installercfg.json` files. They are described  [here](https://github.com/ZzEdovec/quInstaller?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-installer).

### 📦 Building quInstaller
#### Windows
A quick way is still in development, so.. you will need [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html) to continue
1. In the explorer, select all files that the installer needs and click the right mouse button
2. In the context menu, select WinRAR `Add to archieve..`
3. In the window that opens, select `Create SFX archive`. You can change the archive name, format and packaging method as you wish
4. In the `Advanced` tab open `SFX options...`
5. Open `Install` and in the `Run after extraction` field, enter `main.exe`
6. In the `Modes` tab, enable `Unpack to temporary folder` and `Hide all`
7. In the `Icon` tab, you can optionally add the SFX icon, which will be the icon of your installer.
8. Now just click `Ok`, wait for the archive to be created, and that's it! **Your installer is ready.**
#### Linux
1. Install `makeself` through your distribution's package manager or from [GitHub](https://github.com/megastep/makeself)
2. Open terminal and change dir (`cd`) to quInstaller main path
3.  Now use `makeself` using the following template:

`makeself --xz ./ output_file_name "label" env GDK_BACKEND=x11 ./jre/bin/java -jar ./installer.jar`

For example,
`makeself --xz ./ rudi_installer "Rudi installer package" env GDK_BACKEND=x11 ./jre/bin/java -jar ./installer.jar`

You can see the full `makeself` documentation [here](https://github.com/megastep/makeself?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).

**And... that's all**. The installer of your program is ready. You can publish it.
